# STEAMHACKs 2023 - Project Submission

This repository contains my project submitted to **STEAMHACKs 2023**, a hackathon held for high school students across Vietnam. The project includes two submodules, each representing a project for different rounds of the competition, with the final submodule featuring the **award-winning project** from **Round 3**.

## About STEAMHACKs 2023

**STEAMHACKs 2023** is a hackathon organized by **STEAM FOR VIETNAM**, **Hanoi University of Science and Technology**, **The American Center of Hanoi**, and **Ho Chi Minh City**. The event challenges participants not only to develop technical solutions but also to ensure their projects are practical, viable, and beneficial to society.

The competition consists of 3 rounds, with roles for **Programmers** and **Hipsters** (design, presentation, project management):

1. **Round 1**:  
   - **Programmers**: Deliver a small AI-related project.  
   - **Hipsters**: Submit a **visual design** for an app (desktop/mobile/web).  
   - Total participants: 467.

2. **Round 2**:  
   - Teams of 3-4 participants build a tech product based on provided topics.  
   - Total participants: 120 (~35 teams).

3. **Round 3**:  
   - Teams refine their products, add features, and pitch their projects in front of experts (Engineer, UX/UI, Design Lead, Project Manager).  
   - Finalists: 19 teams, with only 7 teams awarded prizes, including the **Grand Prize**.
